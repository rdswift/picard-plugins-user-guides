msgid "This plugin reads the album and track metadata provided to Picard and exposes the information in a number of additional variables for use in Picard scripts. The plugin has been designed such that the information is presented consistently regardless of whether or not the `Use standardized artist names` option is selected. This means that some of the information available through the standard Picard tags will be duplicated in the variables provided by this plugin."
