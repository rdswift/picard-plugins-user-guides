msgid "To use this function, you must first match your files to the appropriate tracks for a release. Once this is done, but before you save your files if you have Picard set to overwrite the ``isrc`` tag in your files, right-click the release and select \"Submit ISRCs\" in the \"Plugins\" section. For each file that has a single valid ISRC in its metadata, the ISRC will be added to the recording on the release if it does not already exist. Once all tracks for the release have been processed, the missing ISRCs will be submitted to MusicBrainz."
