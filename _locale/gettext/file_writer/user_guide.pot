#: ../../file_writer/user_guide.rst:16
msgid "This plugin provides a new script function ``$writeline()`` to write entries to a file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../file_writer/user_guide.rst:18
msgid "Usage: **$writeline(file,text[,reset])**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../file_writer/user_guide.rst:20
msgid "This will write ``text`` (followed by a newline) to ``file``. The text will be appended to the file unless ``reset`` is set, in which case the file will be overwritten. If the destination ``file`` path is not specified as an absolute path to the destination file (beginning with a Windows drive letter and colon or path separator), then the path will be considered relative to the **Destination directory** specified in Picard's **File Naming** option settings. If the target path does not exist, it will be created automatically."

msgid "The plugin uses the following logic to determine whether or not to write to the file:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../file_writer/user_guide.rst:28
