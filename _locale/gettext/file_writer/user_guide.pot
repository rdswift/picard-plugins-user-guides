msgid "Usage: **$writeline(file,text[,reset])**"

#: ../../file_writer/user_guide.rst:17
msgid "This will write ``text`` (followed by a newline) to ``file``. The text will be appended to the file unless ``reset`` is set, in which case the file will be overwritten. If the destination ``file`` path is not specified as an absolute path to the destination file (beginning with a Windows drive letter and colon or path separator), then the path will be considered relative to the **Destination directory** specified in Picard's **File Naming Options** settings. If the target path does not exist, it will be created automatically."
