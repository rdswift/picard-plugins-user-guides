#: ../../performer_tag_replace/user_guide.rst:13
msgid "This plugin reads the track metadata provided to Picard, extracts the list of associated instrument and vocal performers, and updates the performer keys based on the original/replacement pairs specified in the settings panel."

msgid "There is also a setting which allows the user to choose whether or not to apply the replacements to the artist values in addition to the instrument / vocal keys. By default, only the keys are processed."

#: ../../performer_tag_replace/user_guide.rst:42
msgid "Suppose that you don't like instruments listed as \"instrument family\", but would rather have it shown as the plural of the instrument. This could be done using the following:"

msgid "Note that the last line begins with a single space."
msgstr ""

#: ../../performer_tag_replace/user_guide.rst:54
msgid "This would cause the performer credit ``Performer [guitar family]: Chet Atkins`` to be changed to ``Performer [guitars]: Chet Atkins``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../performer_tag_replace/user_guide.rst:56
msgid "Note that the ``s family=ses`` would match an instrument family where the instrument ended in \"s\" and add \"es\" rather than just an \"s\". For example if there was a \"bass family\", this would change it to \"basses\" rather than \"basss\". (As of this writing, I don't think there are any cases in the database where the instrument in an instrument family ends with an \"s\", so that replacement pair should never be triggered.)"

#: ../../performer_tag_replace/user_guide.rst:75
