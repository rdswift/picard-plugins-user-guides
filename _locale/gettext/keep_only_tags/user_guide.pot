#: ../../keep_only_tags/user_guide.rst:16
msgid "This plugin reads the album and track metadata provided to Picard and converts any tags not found in the user's \"keep\" list into hidden variables by adding \"``_ko_``\" to the start of the tag name. The hidden variabled will not be written to the output file."

msgid "If a tag in the list ends with an asterisk (``*``), then it will keep any tags beginning with the tag. For example, if your list contains \"``performer:\\*``\" then all tags beginning with \"``performer:``\" will be kept, such as \"``performer:instrument``\" and \"``performer:vocals``\"."

#: ../../keep_only_tags/user_guide.rst:37
msgid "All tags that are removed will still be available as variables with \"``_ko_``\" prepended to the tag name. For example, if you choose not to keep the \"``musicbrainz_trackid``\" tag, it will still be available to scripts as \"``%_ko_musicbrainz_trackid%``\"."
