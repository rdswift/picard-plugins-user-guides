msgid "This plugin provides a different approach for the user to determine which tags are written to the output files by Picard. If the user only wants to keep a small subset of the tags provided by MusicBrainz, they can specify only the tags that they want to keep rather than develop a lengthy tagger script to remove all of the tags that they don't want."
msgstr ""

#: ../../keep_only_tags/user_guide.rst:11
msgid "Use with caution, because any tags not included in the user's \"keep\" list will **not** be written to the output files. As always, it is recommended that you first test your setup on a **copy** of a small subset of files to ensure that the results are as expected."

msgstr ""

#: ../../keep_only_tags/user_guide.rst:17
msgid "This plugin reads the album and track metadata provided to Picard and converts any tags not found in the user's \"keep\" list into hidden variables by adding \"``_ko_``\" to the start of the tag name. The hidden variabled will not be written to the output file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../keep_only_tags/user_guide.rst:21
msgid "This plugin is configured to run before all other plugins, so that it is working with the standard set of tags provided by MusicBrainz."

#: ../../keep_only_tags/user_guide.rst:34
msgid "Tags that you wish to keep are entered in the options settings, with each tag on a separate line. Blank lines will be ignored. The entries are not case-sensitive."
msgstr ""

#: ../../keep_only_tags/user_guide.rst:36
msgid "If a tag in the list ends with an asterisk (``*``), then it will keep any tags beginning with the tag. For example, if your list contains \"``performer:\\*``\" then all tags beginning with \"``performer:``\" will be kept, such as \"``performer:instrument``\" and \"``performer:vocals``\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../keep_only_tags/user_guide.rst:38
msgid "All tags that are removed will still be available as variables with \"``_ko_``\" prepended to the tag name. For example, if you choose not to keep the \"``musicbrainz_trackid``\" tag, it will still be available to scripts as \"``%_ko_musicbrainz_trackid%``\"."
