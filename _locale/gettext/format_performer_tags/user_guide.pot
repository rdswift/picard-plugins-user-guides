msgstr ""

#: ../../format_performer_tags/user_guide.rst:21
msgid "Picard will by default try to order the performer/instrument credits by the name of the performers, summing up all instruments for that performer in one line. This plugin will order the performer/instrument credits by instrument, summing up all performers that play them."

#: ../../format_performer_tags/user_guide.rst:92
msgid "The problem with this is that it is a bit indistinct if these keywords say something about the instrument, the artist and their performing role, the voice's register, or the persons relation to the group/orchestra. For instance:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../format_performer_tags/user_guide.rst:94
msgid "'additional' is referring to instrumentation. For example 'additional percussion'."

msgstr ""

#: ../../format_performer_tags/user_guide.rst:128
msgid "You can also define what characters you want to use for delimiting or surrounding the keywords. For some situations you might want to use the more common parenthesis brackets (), or maybe you prefer less common brackets such as [] or \\<\\>. Note that using default parenthesis might confuse possible subsequent tagging formulas in the music player/manager of your choice. You can also just leave them blank, or use commas, spaces, etc."

msgid "The second group of settings is the **Section Display Settings**. This is where you configure the text included at the beginning and end of each section displayed, and the characters used to separate multiple items within a section.
