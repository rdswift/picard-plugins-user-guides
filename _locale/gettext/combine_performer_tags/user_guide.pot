msgid "This plugin combines all instrument and vocal performer tags into a new multi-value variable ``%_performers%`` for each track. It requires that the \"**Use track relationships**\" setting is enabled in **Options** -> **Metadata**. Depending on the \"Grouping\" setting, each item in the variable is either the performer's name followed by the instruments and vocals they performed (e.g. \"*Jackson Browne: acoustic guitar, piano, lead vocals*\") or the instrument or vocal name followed by the artists associated with that instrument or vocal (e.g. \"*acoustic guitar: Jackson Browne, Clarence White (additional)*\")."
