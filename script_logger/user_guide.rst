Script Logger
==============

Overview
---------

This plugin provides the ability to write entries to Picard's system log from both user scripts and file naming scripts.


What it Does
----------------

This plugin provides a new script function ``$logline()`` to write entries to Picard's system log. By default, the log level is set at ``Info``, but any level can be used by providing the level as an optional second parameter to the function. The function is available to both user scripts and file naming scripts.

The function is used as ``$logline(text[,level])``, where ``text`` is the text to write to the log. The entry will be written at log level ``Info`` by default, but this can be changed by specifying a different level as an optional second parameter. Allowable log levels are:

- E (Error)
- W (Warning)
- I (Info)
- D (Debug)

If an unknown level is entered, the function will use the default `Info` level.


Option Settings
----------------

There are no option settings for this plugin.


Examples
---------

``$logline(This is a text message.)`` will add "Script Logger: This is a test message." to the log at the ``Info`` level.

``$logline(This is another text message.,)`` will add "Script Logger: This is another test message." to the log at the ``Info`` level.

``$logline(This is an error message.,E)`` will add "Script Logger: This is an error message." to the log at the ``Error`` level.

``$logline(This is another error message.,Error)`` will add "Script Logger: This is another error message." to the log at the ``Error`` level.
