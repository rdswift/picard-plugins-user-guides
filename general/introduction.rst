.. MusicBrainz Picard Documentation Project

Introduction
============

MusicBrainz Picard is a cross-platform music file tagger. The software is open source and is developed by the `MetaBrainz Foundation <https://metabrainz.org/>`_. It is also **very** extensible via the use of plugins, which can add additional functionality to the base program.

This site contains user guides for various Picard plugins developed or maintained by Bob Swift. Each guide provides comprehensive information related to the use of a specific plugin, including configuration options, usage details and examples. It also provides links to additional information including the GitHub repository containing the source code for the plugin.

Problems with the documentation or suggestions for improvements can be reported via the `issues tracker <https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins-user-guides/issues>`_ on GitHub.

.. Translations of this documentation into other languages are very welcome. If you would like to contribute a translation, please visit our `Weblate server <https://weblate.rsds.ca>`_.

If you find a plugin useful, please consider making a donation to the `MetaBrainz Foundation <https://metabrainz.org/donate>`_ to support the continued development of MusicBrainz Picard and related projects.
