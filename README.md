# Picard Plugins User Guides

MusicBrainz Picard is a cross-platform music file tagger. The software is open source and is developed by the `MetaBrainz Foundation <https://metabrainz.org/>`_. It is also very extensible via the use of plugins, which can add additional functionality to the base program.

This site contains user guides for various Picard plugins developed or maintained by Bob Swift. Each guide provides comprehensive information related to the use of a specific plugin, including configuration options, usage details and examples. It also provides links to additional information including the GitHub repository containing the source code for the plugin.
